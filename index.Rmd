## Bio

Maude Elovitz (she/her) is a recent Data Science Graduate from Simmons University. She is passionate about data for good, education, and hopeful to pursue a career in technology, more specifically, a career in data science. She enjoys applied mathematics, and is currently working as a Math Support and Enrichment Educator, where she finds new ways to help lower and middle school students learn basic mathematics while gaining experience in a professional work environment. In her data science education, Maude elevated her research experience from research assistant where she is published with Dr. Valerie Leiter, to research fellow, to, finally, conducting and running her own research project. Maude presented her research at the New England Political Science Associations' Annual 2022 meeting in New Hampshire. Along with many statistical analysis achievements, during her undergraduate career, Maude worked in various leadership positions at Simmons. These included, but were not limited to, being the Varsity captain for 3+ years on her NCAA DIII rowing team, being a teachers assistant in Introduction to Mathematics, and leading the Simmons Academic Mentors team in the Senior position.
